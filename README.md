## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to run both the frontend and backend servers on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Step 1: Add Google Maps API Key (Required for Checkout)

The checkout page uses the Google Maps API to allow customers to pin their delivery location.

1.  Obtain a Google Maps API Key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/overview). Make sure it has the **Maps JavaScript API** and **Places API** enabled.
2.  Open the file `frontend/index.html`.
3.  Find the line with the Google Maps script tag.
4.  Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual key:

    ````html
    <!-- BEFORE -->
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>

    <!-- AFTER -->
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSy...your...actual...key&libraries=places"></script>
    ``` > **Note:** Without a valid API key, the map on the checkout page will
    not load.
    ````

### Step 2: Running the Backend Server

The backend server must be running for the frontend to fetch data.

1.  Open a new terminal window.
2.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
3.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The backend API will now be running at `http://localhost:3001`. Keep this terminal window open.

### Step 3: Running the Frontend Application

1.  Open a **second, separate** terminal window.
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the Vite development server:
    `sh
npm run dev
`
    The application will now be available at the local address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
